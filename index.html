    <p data-w-id="afdceddf-1313-6d55-5735-d79d4ef0f9f7" style="opacity:0" class="paragraph">A student at Eastern Washington University in my final year of school, I&#x27;m passionate about a lot of things. Here are a few of them:<br><br>‍<strong class="bold-text">Learning.</strong> I consider myself a lifelong learner, not only as a passionate academic but as a student of life. I like to grow and become in whatever realm I&#x27;m in.<br><br>‍<strong>Writing.</strong> Writing is how I express myself, and words are the air I breathe.<br><br>‍<strong>Making friends.</strong> I get a special thrill from meeting new people. Hearing others&#x27; stories inspires me for the intricacies of every individual life and the world we live in. We have a lot we can learn from each other. Plus, new friends are just great.<br><br>‍<strong>Trying new things.</strong> I am unashamed of the things I&#x27;m terrible at (aka, sports) but a wholehearted advocate for embracing new things. Coding! Brewing my own kombucha. Cooking new recipes. Solo traveling. Taking yourself out to dinner with a good book.<br><br>‍<strong>A few other things to note:<br><br>‍</strong>I was a Mechanical Engineering major for three years before switching to Technical Communication. Since switching, I&#x27;ve never felt that a field of study was so tailored for me. Plus, getting to learn code as an English major is really fun.<br><br>My new major has given me some cool opportunities, like interning at the Spokane annual Get Lit! festival (getting to sit next to authors while they signed books was pretty sweet). Over the summer of 2019, I interned at Family Promise of Spokane, a nonprofit homeless shelter, where I wrote stories about families I got to meet and interview who are experiencing homelessness. Winter quarter 2020, I interned at Desautel Hege, a PR firm in downtown Spokane. At DH I got to write, research and promote content for positive campaign messages in social awareness and public health sectors. It was an incredible experience for the type of work I&#x27;d love to build a career in.<br><br>I am a huge advocate for mental health awareness and suicide prevention. One day I hope to use my writing and experiences to help others find freedom and healing.<br><br>One time I took a quarter off of school to live in Pisa, Italy for two months as an au pair. It was dreamy!<br><br>I LOVE making friends.<br>‍<br>I have three sisters of whom I am very close to, as well as six brothers. I am the youngest in my family (10 kids total, all biological) and I don&#x27;t know where I would be without them.<br><br><strong>Thanks for checking out my webpage. I&#x27;d love to be your friend.</strong></p>
